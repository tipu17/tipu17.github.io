this a book that gives you the basics of intelligence
well the standazised way of learnning and testing people dosent give a correct view of intelligence

intelligence isent a well defined term or thing
so its hard not only to evalueate it but also to build it or create it/ learn it

in this book I am going to provide some basic frondations on which you can become intelligent. 

what I think intelligence is 
- creativity
- memory
- solve problems 
- seeing the world as it is 
- logic


the way I see intelligence is the why phylosophers thought 

creativity  -  intellugent people can create knowleged when they need it you don't need to memorise formulas you just have to smart enough to find that formula or create that formula when you come acrocess a problem that need that formula

rationality  -  is also intelligence it is the most important part of intelligence because if you arnt rational then your basicly the dumpest creature if planit.

wise  -  a wise person is quit important it a one of the most useful trates that decides how far a person is going to go and what kind of life he is going to have and if he/she is going to be satisfied with his or her life.

that ability to connect dots and figure things out  -  this one of the skill that is absolutely needed and everybody has it in someway or the other it the basic human thing. when we see a machanical clock and open it ever one can figure our what weel is turning what weel and being turned by what weel

a good base of knowleged  -  A person needs to have a wide varite of nkowleged to be truely intelligent but its impossible so here is what you can do you can only know a little of everything it dosent only means that you learn something from all the disiplins, it manns that you learns the bascis or the important thing in that disaplin or subject by important i mean useful some thing that you feel will be useful later in life. and also you need to know enough to know what you know , know what you don't , and you dont know what you don't know..

this book is also going to have types of reasoning and login and logical falacies
